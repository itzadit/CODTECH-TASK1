## Overview of the Project

### Project: Password Strength Checker

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a web-based application for assessing password strength. The application provides real-time feedback on password complexity, encourages the use of strong passwords, and enhances security by offering an interactive and user-friendly interface.

### Key Activities
- **Password Evaluation**: Implementing an algorithm to analyze the strength of passwords based on criteria such as length, complexity, and use of various character types.

- **User Interface Design**: Designing a clean and intuitive UI to allow users to input passwords and receive immediate feedback. This includes integrating functionalities like password visibility toggle using eye icons.

- **Feedback and Visualization**: Providing users with visual indicators of password strength and textual feedback on how to improve their passwords.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS**: For building and styling the web interface, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

- **JavaScript**: To handle dynamic interactions such as toggling password visibility and sending requests to the server for password evaluation.

- **Python (Flask)**: For creating a backend service to evaluate password strength and return appropriate feedback.

- **Flask-CORS**: To handle cross-origin requests and ensure seamless interaction between the frontend and backend services.
